Squamigera: A tool for sorting the pixels on your screen.

When you feel disorganized, the squamigera project can help. It takes all those nasty unordered pixels on your screen and sorts them on their rgb value, giving you a nicely sorted screen.
As an example take this unsorted image below:

![unsorted](/res/unsorted.png)

Now once squamigera starts running, it will start sorting your pixels with a randomized algorithm, which gives us the visually pleasing result:

![progress]{/res/progress.png}

Finally, after a while the image will start looking a lot better:

![sorted]{/res/sorted.png}
